									<h3>The Create Conference Mission</h3>
								</header>
								<div class="content">
									<p>In the beginning, God created the heavens, the earth, and all that is within them. We know that God created all things by His will, holds all things together, and upholds all things by the word of His power. And yet, when creating mankind, God instructed them to &quot;be fruitful and multiply, and fill the earth, and subdue it.&quot; From the beginning, God has invited mankind to partner with Him as co-laborers in the stewardship and cultivation of the earth and humanity. In the New Testament, Christians are commanded to &quot;Go, therefore, and make disciples of all the nations.&quot; Again, we know that God draws the unbelieving to Himself through the work of the Holy Spirit and the sacrifice of Jesus Christ. But still, God invites His people to participate in the work. What does this mean practically? The Create Conference seeks to spark a dialogue to answer this question. Some people are called to professional ministry positions (pastor, missionary, ministry staff, etc...) but most of us are called to &quot;normal&quot; lives. Whether you are an artist, athlete, engineer, nurse, or whatever profession you find yourself doing, God invites all Christians to be His fellow laborers. The Create Conference is focused on encouraging and connecting Young Adults in the Greater San Diego Area. However, anyone who wants to become better equipped to Make Disciples in their sphere of influence is welcome to attend.</p>

									<h3>Renewed</h3>
								</header>
								<div class="content">
									<p>This year’s theme is based on Colossians 3:9-10 which says, <i>“Do not lie to one another, since you have put off the old self with its practices 10 and have put on the new self. You are being renewed in knowledge according to the image of your Creator.”</i> You are a New Creation. This is Paul’s repeated messages for believers. Put another way: The Gospel Changes Everything. Your purpose, your goals, your motivation, your desires, your thoughts, your words, and your actions are all changed through salvation. You are being saved from your old life and its consequences to a new life in Christ. Through our series this year, we will take a gospel informed view on some of the most important aspects of our lives.</p>
